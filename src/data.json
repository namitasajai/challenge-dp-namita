              "A": "T-trauma? Who has that? Ha. Hahahahahahahahah-",
              "B": "My parents are two very nice, gentle people who never really wanted to commit to the responsibilities of childrearing and I suffered for it.",

              "A": "Yes, but it is my father who is doing the sponging.",
              "B": "No, I do not dream because I cannot fall asleep at night because I worry that my parents hate me.",
              "C": "Yes, except I wasn't dreaming, and I was, in fact, remembering the last night I spent time with my mother before returning to school.",
              "D": " I'm allergic to sponges, so this is not a dream, but a nightmare."

          "options": {
              "A": "No, because my father's voice is identical to that of James Earl Jones and I think every man sounds like James Earl Jones.",
              "B": "No, because my father has a medical condition that does not allow him to speak.",
              "C": "No, because I have not talked to my father since I left home.",
              "D": "No, because my father is a chronic smoker, smokes twenty cigarettes a day, and as a result his voice becomes more unrecognizable with every passing day."

      "Your parents don't miss you and just feel obligated to talk to you when they call. You are a nuisance in their life and a constant drain on their financial resources. You're the reason they weren't able to go to Cancun this year, and you should be ashamed of it.",
      "Your parents don't miss you and just feel obligated to talk to you! You are their greatest disappointment, and you will never live up to the high expectations set by your older sibling. You will forever live in their shadow, and your parents will leave everything to your high-achieving sibling and will only leave you one bean.",
      "Your parents feel obligated to talk to you, but still love you. They are just rediscovering themselves in their old age and deserve the time to do so. They'll always be there for you, and are your biggest supporters. I hope you give them the chance to do so.",
      "Your parents don't miss you, and you are in fact a horrible person. Your parents are right to disown you. I am sorry, but you will need to put yourself up for adoption right now."
